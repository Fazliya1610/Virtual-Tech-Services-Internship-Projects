# Machine Learning Internship Projects

As a part of my Machine Learning Internship at Virtual Tech Services, I have completed the following projects in my learning process:
- Basics with DataFrame
- Basics with Excel Data
- Image Generation using NLP
- Linear and Logistic Regression using Array
- Linear and Logistic Regression using Excel Data
- Sentiment Analysis with BERT
- Siamese Neural Network using TensorFlow

The major projects are:
1. **Image Generation using NLP**
2. **Sentiment Analysis with BERT**
3. **Siamese Neural Network using TensorFlow**

## Major Projects

### Image Generation using NLP
This project involves generating images based on natural language prompts. The project utilizes Google's Translator for language translation and the Stable Diffusion model for image generation.

### Sentiment Analysis with BERT
This project involves using the BERT model to analyze sentiment from text data. It leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library to classify sentiments in multiple languages.

### Siamese Neural Network using TensorFlow
This project involves creating a Siamese Neural Network to compare the similarity between two inputs. The network uses convolutional layers and is trained to distinguish between pairs of similar and dissimilar images.
